        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a very simple recipe for crunchy oat muesli.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300g oats</li>
            <li>90g coconut oil</li>
            <li>90g agave or rice sirup</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon, vanilla sugar and/or cardamom</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 150Â°C. Line a baking tray with baking paper.</li>
            <li>Grind about 100g of the oats to smaller pieces. They don't have to become as finely ground as flour, but in my experience, grinding some of the oats makes everything stick together a bit better in the end.</li>
            <li>Mix the coconut oil, the sirup and any spices you might like. I usually use cinnamon, cardamom and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Mix the oats, the partially ground oats and the oil-sirup mixture together and knead well using your hands. As a pro tip, use food-safe disposable gloves, as things get really sticky here.</li>
            <li>Put the muesli on the baking tray and bake for around 20 to 30 minutes. Check on it in between so it doesn't get too dark. When taken out of the oven, the muesli will be soft, this is normal. It becomes crunchy as it gets cold.</li>
        </ol>
